# 🎓 Creating a Student-Driven Educational Server 📚

At our company, we specialize in creating market-driven products that meet the needs of our target audience. In this case, our target audience and rather we should say our players are the  students who are passionate about their academic portfolios but don't have access to educational content, compensated by those who are interested in learning new things.

## 🤔 Understanding Our Target Audience

To create a successful product, we need to understand our players' needs and preferences. Based on our research, we have identified two key assumptions about our target audience:

1. They need grades and have access to educational content. ( first set of players )
2. They are interested in learning and expanding their knowledge. (  set of players )

With these assumptions in mind, we have identified several features that have the potential to create a successful student driven platform,  if implemented correctly.

## 💡 Theoretical Features

1. Cascading of knowledge
2. Promotion of accessibility to Content
3. Addressing the fed-Up Students with the Old Educational System
4. Incorporation of Features in the Schooling System
5. Decentralizing the System and Making it More Flexible (like YouTube)
6. Students for Students Idea (like NPTEL but for students)
7. Content-Free, Open Accessibility to Main Educational Content (unlike coaching mafias like Unacademy, which charges premium)

While each of these features has the potential to create a successful product, we have yet to find a platform that incorporates all of them, that's our trial.


## 🎮 Gamifying Education

To make our product more engaging and effective, we plan to incorporate gamification. This will help to address features 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6. By gamifying education, we can make learning more fun and rewarding, which can help to keep students motivated and engaged.

## 📝 Activity Corner

Another way to keep students engaged is to provide them with an activity corner. This can be divided into two sections:

1. For You (Strengthening Yourself)
2. For Unlike You (Diversification)

This will give students a chance to explore new topics and expand their knowledge in areas they may not have considered before.


## 🔔 Pop-Ups

To capture students' attention and keep them engaged, we plan to incorporate pop-ups. These can be used to provide students with helpful tips, fun facts, or reminders about upcoming activities or assignments.

## 📄 Documentation

To make it easier for coders to work with our platform and for schools to adapt it to their needs, we will provide detailed documentation. This will help to ensure that our platform is accessible and user-friendly for everyone.

With these features in mind, we believe that we can create a successful student-driven educational server that meets the needs of our target audience.
